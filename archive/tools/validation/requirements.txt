# Requirements for omni* ecosystem validation tools
# These are minimal dependencies for the validation scripts

# No external dependencies required - validation scripts use only Python stdlib:
# - ast (for parsing Python code)
# - pathlib (for file system operations)
# - re (for pattern matching)
# - argparse (for command-line interfaces)
# - dataclasses (for data structures)
# - typing (for type hints)

# Optional: If you want enhanced functionality, uncomment these:
# pydantic>=2.0.0  # For advanced model validation
# pyyaml>=6.0      # For YAML configuration parsing
# requests>=2.28.0 # For API-based validation (future use)

# The validation tools are designed to work with Python 3.11+ standard library only
# to minimize dependencies and ensure they work in any environment.
