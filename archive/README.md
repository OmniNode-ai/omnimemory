# OmniMemory - Advanced Memory Management System

An advanced memory management and retrieval system designed for AI applications, providing comprehensive memory capabilities including persistent storage, vector-based semantic memory, temporal patterns, and cross-modal integration.

## Overview

OmniMemory provides a sophisticated memory architecture that mirrors human-like memory systems, enabling AI applications to store, retrieve, and consolidate information across multiple modalities and time scales. The system supports both short-term and long-term memory patterns with intelligent decay and consolidation mechanisms.

## 🧠 Memory Architecture

### Core Memory Systems

**4 Primary Memory Types** covering comprehensive memory management:

### 💾 Persistent Memory
- `PersistentMemory` - Long-term storage with database persistence
- `VersionedMemory` - Memory with version control and history tracking
- `EncryptedMemory` - Secure memory storage with encryption at rest

### 🔍 Semantic Memory
- `VectorMemory` - Vector-based semantic similarity and retrieval
- `EmbeddingMemory` - High-dimensional embedding storage and search
- `SemanticGraph` - Knowledge graph representation for complex relationships

### ⏰ Temporal Memory
- `TemporalMemory` - Time-aware memory with decay patterns
- `ScheduledMemory` - Memory with scheduled retrieval and updates
- `ContextualMemory` - Memory that adapts based on contextual patterns

### 🔄 Memory Consolidation
- `ConsolidationEngine` - Automatic memory consolidation and optimization
- `MemoryCompressor` - Intelligent memory compression and archival
- `PatternExtractor` - Extract recurring patterns for optimization

## 🎯 Memory Patterns

All memory systems follow advanced memory science principles:

- **Hierarchical Storage** - Multi-tier memory with automatic promotion/demotion
- **Temporal Decay** - Natural forgetting patterns with configurable decay rates
- **Consolidation** - Automatic memory consolidation during low-activity periods
- **Cross-Modal Integration** - Memory across text, embeddings, and structured data
- **Contextual Retrieval** - Context-aware memory retrieval with relevance scoring

## 🔧 Common Usage Patterns

### Memory Storage and Retrieval
```python
# Store complex memories with metadata
memory_manager.store_complex(
    content="Important technical decision",
    metadata={"project": "omnimemory", "importance": 0.9},
    embeddings=vector_embeddings,
    temporal_context={"created": datetime.now()}
)

# Retrieve with multi-modal search
results = memory_manager.search(
    query="technical decisions",
    include_semantic=True,
    include_temporal=True,
    max_results=10
)
```

### Temporal Memory Management
```python
# Set up temporal memory with decay
temporal_memory = TemporalMemory(
    decay_rate=0.1,          # 10% decay per day
    consolidation_threshold=0.5,
    max_age_days=365
)

# Store with temporal context
temporal_memory.store_with_context(
    "user_preference_change",
    context={"timestamp": now, "importance": 0.8}
)
```

### Memory Consolidation
```python
# Manual consolidation trigger
consolidation_engine = ConsolidationEngine()
consolidation_report = consolidation_engine.consolidate(
    memory_types=["vector", "temporal"],
    strategy="importance_based"
)

# Automatic consolidation scheduling
scheduler = MemoryScheduler()
scheduler.schedule_consolidation(
    frequency="daily",
    low_activity_hours=[2, 3, 4]  # 2-4 AM
)
```

## 🤝 Usage Examples

### Basic Memory Operations

manager.store_text("Meeting notes from Q1 planning")
manager.store_structured({"decision": "use_postgres", "rationale": "scalability"})
manager.store_embedding(vector_data, metadata={"source": "user_feedback"})
```

### Advanced Memory Retrieval
```python
# Complex memory search
results = manager.advanced_search(
    query="database decisions",
    filters={
        "timeframe": "last_30_days",
        "importance": ">0.7",
        "project": "omnimemory"
    },
    ranking="hybrid",  # combine semantic + temporal + importance
    max_results=5
)

# Memory consolidation and cleanup
consolidation_results = manager.consolidate(
    strategy="pattern_based",
    preserve_important=True,
    compress_old=True
)
```
