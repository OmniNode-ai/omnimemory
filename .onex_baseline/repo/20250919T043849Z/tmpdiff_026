+ONEX Model Package - OmniMemory Foundation Architecture
+
+Models are organized into functional domains following omnibase_core patterns:
+- core/: Foundational models, shared types, contracts
+- memory/: Memory storage, retrieval, persistence models
+- intelligence/: Intelligence processing, analysis models
+- service/: Service configurations, orchestration models
+- container/: Container configurations and DI models
+- foundation/: Base implementations and protocols
+
+This __init__.py maintains compatibility by re-exporting
+all models at the package level following ONEX standards.
