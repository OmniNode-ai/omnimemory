+# OmniMemory Project Overview
+
+## Purpose
+Advanced unified memory and intelligence system designed to migrate and modernize 274+ intelligence modules from legacy omnibase_3 into a comprehensive, ONEX-compliant memory architecture. Accelerates development across all omni agents through systematic memory management, retrieval operations, and cross-modal intelligence patterns.
+
+## Tech Stack
+- **Python 3.12+** with Poetry dependency management
+- **FastAPI + Uvicorn** for production API layer
+- **Pydantic 2.10+** for data validation and ONEX compliance
+- **Storage**: PostgreSQL/Supabase, Redis caching, Pinecone vector DB
+- **ONEX Dependencies**: omnibase_spi, omnibase_core (git-based)
+- **Async/await** architecture throughout
+
+## Key Architecture Principles
+- ONEX 4.0 compliance (zero `Any` types, strong typing)
+- Protocol-based design patterns
+- 4-node ONEX architecture (EFFECT → COMPUTE → REDUCER → ORCHESTRATOR)
+- Async-first with comprehensive error handling
+- Contract-driven development with Pydantic models
+
+## Current Status
+- Foundation models implemented (26 Pydantic models, zero Any types)  
+- PR review phase with 10 remaining issues to resolve
+- Directory structure: src/omnimemory/models/{core,memory,intelligence,service,foundation}
