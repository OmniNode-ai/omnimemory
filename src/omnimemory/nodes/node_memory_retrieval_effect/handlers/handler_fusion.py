"""Rank fusion for hybrid retrieval (OMN-16765).

Combines the ranked output of the semantic (Qdrant) and full-text (Postgres)
legs into a single ordering, behind the existing retrieval protocol.

Two concerns are kept separate on purpose:

* :func:`fuse_rrf` is **pure rank fusion**. It consumes ranks and nothing else.
  The two legs produce numerically incomparable quantities — cosine similarity
  in ``[0, 1]`` versus an unbounded Postgres ``ts_rank`` whose magnitude depends
  on document length and term-frequency normalisation — so any score-combining
  scheme would first need a mapping onto a shared scale, and that mapping is a
  fitted parameter with no principled value. Reciprocal Rank Fusion sidesteps it
  entirely by discarding magnitudes.

* :func:`select_relevant` decides **whether a leg has anything to contribute**,
  using each leg's own scores against its own floor. This never compares one
  leg's scores to another's, so it does not reintroduce the scale problem RRF
  exists to avoid.

The split matters because RRF alone cannot tell a leg that answered well from a
leg that answered badly: it gives whatever sits at rank 1 the full ``1/(k+1)``
weight either way. On a paraphrase query the lexical leg may match a stray
lexeme and return a document that is merely present rather than relevant, and
unweighted RRF will promote it to the top of the fused list on the strength of
being that leg's best of a bad set. Gating before fusing is what stops a leg
with no signal from displacing a leg that has some.

    which agreement between legs is rewarded.

    Ties are broken by document id, ascending. RRF produces exact ties whenever
    two documents occupy the same rank in their respective legs, which on any
    real input happens constantly, so the tie-break has to be defined rather
    than left to insertion order.
